# Manufacturing to Quality Control
*   **Steps:** From MANUFACTURING PROCESSES (02) (25) in Manufacturing to SAMPLING AND SAMPLE STORAGE (03) (21) in Quality Control
*   **Type:** Flow Dependencies
*   **Description:** The completion of specific manufacturing stages within MANUFACTURING PROCESSES (PS-MFG-002) directly triggers the need for sample collection for in-process controls (IPCs) or finished product release. This event initiates the SAMPLING AND SAMPLE STORAGE (PS-QC-003) process, making it a critical sequential prerequisite for subsequent quality testing by QC.

*   **Steps:** From MANUFACTURING PROCESSES (02) (25) in Manufacturing to TESTING PREPARATION AND EXECUTION (04) (44) in Quality Control
*   **Type:** Information Integration
*   **Description:** Real-time data, including in-process control (IPC) results and Process Analytical Technology (PAT) data generated during MANUFACTURING PROCESSES (PS-MFG-002), provides crucial information to Quality Control's TESTING PREPARATION AND EXECUTION (PS-QC-004). This immediate feedback enables QC to make informed decisions about testing strategies, potentially allowing for reduced traditional lab testing or rapid intervention if deviations occur.

*   **Steps:** From PRODUCT, SITE, PROCESS DATA USAGE (05) (27) in Manufacturing to QC DATA ANALYSIS AND TRENDING (06) (45) in Quality Control
*   **Type:** Information Integration
*   **Description:** The comprehensive production, site, and process data made accessible and usable by Manufacturing's PRODUCT, SITE, PROCESS DATA USAGE (PS-MFG-005) is a primary and essential input for Quality Control's QC DATA ANALYSIS AND TRENDING (PS-QC-006). This includes batch records, IPC data, and equipment performance data, which QC uses to correlate analytical results, identify trends, predict potential quality issues, and drive process improvements.

*   **Steps:** From CHANGE OVERS (03) (37) in Manufacturing to TESTING PREPARATION AND EXECUTION (04) (44) in Quality Control
*   **Type:** Flow Dependencies
*   **Description:** Following the cleaning and sterilization procedures performed during Manufacturing's CHANGE OVERS (PS-MFG-003), specific cleaning verification samples are collected. These samples must then be submitted to Quality Control's TESTING PREPARATION AND EXECUTION (PS-QC-004) for analysis. The successful testing and release of these samples by QC is a mandatory prerequisite for the manufacturing equipment to be cleared for the next production run.

# Manufacturing to Logistics
*   **Steps:** From MANUFACTURING PROCESSES (02) (25) in Manufacturing to Logistics (06) (29) in Logistics
*   **Type:** Flow Dependencies
*   **Description:** Upon the successful completion of batch production within MANUFACTURING PROCESSES (PS-MFG-002) and subsequent quality release by QA, the finished goods are physically transferred to Logistics (L-06). Logistics then takes over for outbound operations, including warehousing, order fulfillment, and dispatch to the market, representing a critical, sequential hand-off of the final product in the value chain.

# Manufacturing to Maintenance
*   **Steps:** From MANUFACTURING PROCESSES (02) (25) in Manufacturing to Maintenance Scheduling (03) (49) in Maintenance
*   **Type:** Flow Dependencies
*   **Description:** An unexpected equipment breakdown or malfunction during MANUFACTURING PROCESSES (PS-MFG-002) directly triggers the initiation of Corrective Maintenance Execution (Maint-03). Manufacturing personnel are often the first to report these critical issues, requiring immediate intervention from Maintenance to restore functionality and prevent prolonged production halts. This is a vital, reactive interdependence.

*   **Steps:** From EQUIPMENT & AUTOMATION LIFECYCLE PROCESS (04) (26) in Manufacturing to Maintenance Planning (02) (48) in Maintenance
*   **Type:** Information Integration
*   **Description:** Manufacturing's EQUIPMENT & AUTOMATION LIFECYCLE PROCESS (PS-MFG-004) generates comprehensive documentation and data throughout an asset's lifespan, including installation records, qualification documents, modification history, and performance data. This detailed information is a critical and continuous input for Maintenance Planning (Maint-02), enabling maintenance to plan interventions, manage spare parts, and ensure the ongoing reliability and compliance of equipment.
