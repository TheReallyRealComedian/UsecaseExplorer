    *   **Critical Process Parameters (CPPs)**: Process parameters that must be controlled to ensure the product meets its CQAs.
*   **Test & Analytical Data**: Results from QC lab testing (e.g., HPLC results, raw instrument data).
*   **Non-Conformance & Deviation Data**: Records of any departure from approved instructions or specifications.
*   **CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action) Data**: Information on actions taken to address the root cause of deviations and prevent recurrence.
*   **OOS (Out-of-Specification) Data**: Records of test results that fall outside the defined limits.
*   **Change Control Data**: Records of all proposed and implemented changes to processes, systems, or products.
*   **Audit & Inspection Data**: Findings, observations, and reports from internal and external audits/inspections.
*   **Validation & Qualification Data**: Documentation proving that equipment, systems, and processes work as intended (IQ, OQ, PQ, CSV).
*   **CoA (Certificate of Analysis) Data**: Documents from suppliers certifying the quality and specifications of raw materials.
*   **APQR (Annual Product Quality Review) Data**: Annual compilations of all quality-related data for a specific product.
*   **Complaint Data**: Information on technical product complaints received from the market.
*   **Regulatory Intelligence Data (RIN/PIN)**: Information on new or updated regulations and pharmacopoeial requirements.
*   **SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) Data**: The content of controlled procedural documents.

#### 4. Supply Chain & Logistics Data
This data pertains to the movement and management of materials and products.
*   **Inventory Data**: Information on stock levels, including raw materials, work-in-progress (WIP), and finished goods. Includes data on strategic, safety, and cycle stock.
