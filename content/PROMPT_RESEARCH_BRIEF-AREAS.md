**Research Briefing 9: Quality Assurance (QA)**


**Subject:** Research on Common Industry Practices in Pharmaceutical Quality Assurance

**1. Introduction**
We require a comprehensive research study into the common, fundamental operational practices typically performed by pharmaceutical companies within the **Quality Assurance (QA)** area. The primary objective is to understand the very basics of how QA systems and processes function to ensure product quality, safety, efficacy, and regulatory compliance throughout the pharmaceutical manufacturing lifecycle. While advancements and digital practices are of interest, the core focus MUST be on the foundational processes and tasks. NOT THAT THIS IS SPECIFICALLY ON QUALITY ASSURANCE - NOT QUALITY CONTROL - WE KEEP THESE SEPARATE.

The research should detail how this area and its specific process steps are interlinked with other value-creating streams such as Manufacturing, Quality Control, Supply Chain, Regulatory Affairs, and R&D. The level of detail regarding the specific steps and tasks actually performed (e.g., "reviewing an SOP," "conducting GMP training," "managing a change control record," "performing a supplier audit," "investigating a deviation," "releasing a batch") must be very high.

Please structure your findings strictly according to the QA process steps outlined below, as defined in our internal framework.
